#**WEB SCRAPING TEST**
Completed Web Scraping Test.

Once given the assignment I researched different web scraping tools and their accessibility.
This led me to choose JSoup as my tool as it was readily available and included within the maven repository so all that was needed to do was add the library in the Project Structure.
Other tools used include JUnit 5 for testing code and google's JSON simple for converting the elements into a JSON Array.
Once I was familiar with JSoup most of this project was simple enough however I did struggle for a while with dealing with a null value for when aan item didn't have Kcal.

To run the project all you need to do is make sure you have JSoup added and run the main class.
This will output a JSON Array with all the objects and a Total field with price and VAT.
